#  0x0F. Build a web app in JavaScript

## Requirements
- You have to use Bootstrap
- Your styles.css must be as small as you can - you must use as much as you can Bootstrap classes
- You have to use JQuery
- Your scripts.js must contain all your Javascript part
- Your Javascript must be executed only when the document is loaded

You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design/Bootstrap/Javascript knowledges that you learned previously.

You wonâ€™t have a lot of instruction, you are free to implement it the way that you want - the objective is simple: Have fully functional web pages that look the same as the designer file.
